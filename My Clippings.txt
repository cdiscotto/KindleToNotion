In the first four or five months on the job, whenever a rep came in with a problem, I was intent on gaining credibility with the reps, having them like me, and gaining their trust. When they came in with a problem, I’d grab it and run with it. Now that I have more experience, when they come in with a problem, I sit back and ask them questions and let them find the answers.

Create smaller, reusable units of work Once you start to curate a collection of valuable knowledge in external form, a very different way of working becomes not only possible, but necessary. You will begin to think of your projects as made up of discrete parts. I call them “intermediate packets,” which can include any kind of content we’ve already mentioned: a set of notes from a team meeting, a list of relevant research findings, a brainstorm with collaborators, a slide deck analyzing the market, or a list of action items from a conference call, for example.

It seems paradoxical that the managers were both overmanaging the subordinates with more experience and neglecting them. The managers were devoting attention to the wrong issues in their interactions with veteran subordinates. They were spending their time advising and coaching the more-experienced managers on what and how to sell. Instead, they should have been providing them with a sense of their strategic vision and goals for the organization, recognizing their achievements, garnering resources for them to do their jobs, and preparing them for the future:

Finally, as is apparent from this quotation, the managers discovered that firing took skill. You had to be as constructive as possible, to mention only the most significant problems (“They don’t want you to pick out everything they screwed up.”), and at all costs, to allow the person to leave with dignity. To do otherwise would be needlessly cruel.

guess I would have to say, Sit back and listen. A momentum was building before you came; if it was damaged, it’s damaged, and you’re not going to fix it in a month. If it’s undamaged, it probably won’t get damaged in that short a time. Take the time to sit back and listen and establish a routine for yourself. Take it as slow as possible. I think people approach the job the same way I did. “I’m just so excited about it. I’m ecstatic about it. I’m going to just get in there and do all these things.” That attitude is nice, but it is wrong.

Most managers want to think with either their head or their heart. To be really good you have to think with both. If you think with your head, you’ll be dominant, aggressive, boom, boom, boom. The person who thinks with the heart is Miss Milquetoast—nice, nice, nice. The head person loves confrontation. The heart person hates it. Run it like a business—think with your head. But realize you’re dealing with people—think with your heart. It’s a balancing act, and you don’t want to slip too far off in any direction.

If they see you ranting and raving, then they think that is an okay way to behave when they’re frustrated; it can quickly get out of hand. You have to teach them through your behavior what it means to be a professional. You can’t take things personally all the time and just let out your feelings.

People find it easier to act themselves into a new way of thinking than to think themselves into a new way of acting. People learn skills best by practice plus systematic feedback. Mintzberg observes: Management schools will begin the serious training of managers when skill training takes a serious place next to cognitive learning. Cognitive learning is detached and informational, like reading a book or listening to a lecture. No doubt much important cognitive material must be assimilated by the manager-to-be. But cognitive learning no more makes a manager than it does a swimmer. The latter will drown the first time he jumps into the water if his coach never takes him out of the lecture hall, gets him wet, and gives him feedback on his performance.23

Becoming a manager required a profound psychological adjustment—a transformation. Some transitions are changes that keep an individual on a fixed career track, like the pilot’s minor adjustments in heading an airplane to maintain a steady course. Others—like the promotion to management—are turning points shifting the entire balance and direction of one’s career, like the pilot’s submitting a new flight plan when changing destinations. The new managers had to learn how to think, feel, and value as managers instead of as individual contributors. To make the psychological adjustment, they had to address four tasks: • Learning what it means to be a manager • Developing interpersonal judgment • Gaining self-knowledge • Coping with stress and emotion 2. Becoming a manager was largely a process of learning from experience. New managers could only grasp their new role and identity through action, not contemplation. They learned by facing real problems and real consequences. Consequently, the transformation was iterative, slow, and difficult, both intellectually and emotionally.

Reflecting on experience is a means of having a Socratic dialogue with yourself, asking the right questions at the right time, in order to discover the truth of yourself and your life. What really happened? Why did it happen? What did it do to me? What did it mean to me? In this way, one locates and appropriates the knowledge one needs or, more precisely, recovers what one knew but had forgotten, and becomes, in Goethe’s phrase, the hammer rather than the anvil.12

Perhaps more important than the organization’s formal resources are the more informal ones that new managers must create for themselves. They cannot fail to devote time and energy to building and maintaining a network of relationships (superior and lateral, internal and perhaps external to the organization) from which they can derive support, feedback, and advice.13 These relationships can be helpful only if the managers are willing to take some risk, disclose some of their problems, and open themselves to constructive criticism. They will have to fight the tendency to avoid their superiors.

If an organization could make only one intervention that would improve development of new management, I believe it should be to provide senior executives with training on how to be better coaches. Senior managers can be educated—more accurately, reminded—about the challenges of the transition from individual contributor to manager, its critical lessons, and the resources new managers find most helpful in making the transition. Specifically, they should be given training in setting appropriate expectations for new managers, providing feedback effectively, and responding appropriately to the inevitable mistakes that new managers will make.

When most people become managers, they focus first on their team of direct reports and the associated formal authority—the rights and privileges associated with getting a promotion. They expect to have more authority and freedom. They soon discover, however, that what they have actually gained are new duties, obligations, and interdependencies. Instead of feeling free, most feel incredibly constrained—especially if they were accustomed to the relative freedom of being a star.

Effective managers don’t rely on formal authority as their source of power, even when they have it. Why not? Because when managers rely on formal authority, although they may get control over those whom they are trying to influence, they do not get commitment. Individuals are not engaged and inspired when controlled; commitment comes with empowerment or sharing the potential to influence. Only when empowered and committed are people willing to take the calculated risks necessary to cope with the need for continuous change and improvement we see in today’s organizations.

There are four components of personal power: expertise, track record, attractiveness, and effort. Expertise refers to task or organizationally relevant competencies. The more unique and critical a person’s expertise, the more important it will be as a source of power. While many people tend to focus on technical expertise, in managerial work, expertise in the human (ability to manage work relationships) and conceptual (ability to see an enterprise as a whole) arenas is of even greater import.7 Track record refers to managers’ organizationally relevant experience and accomplishments. Further, it is not just what they have done, but how they have done it. Those who have a positive track record have more power than those who do not.

There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.2 Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely.

Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now Projects include the short-term outcomes you’re actively working toward right now. Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.”

Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time As important as projects are, not everything is a project. For example, the area of our lives called “Finances” doesn’t have a definite end date. It’s something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or another, for as long as we live. It doesn’t have a final objective. Even if you win the lottery, you’ll still have finances to manage (and it will probably require a lot more attention!).

Writers who have delved into human nature, ancient masters of strategy, historians of human stupidity and folly, kings and queens who have learned the hard way how to handle the burdens of power—their knowledge is gathering dust, waiting for you to come and stand on their shoulders. Their wit can be your wit, their skill can be your skill, and they will never come around to tell people how unoriginal you really are. You can slog through life, making endless mistakes, wasting time and energy trying to do things from your own experience. Or you can use the armies of the past.

Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.

In the realm of power you must learn to judge your moves by their long-term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or gain a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain how it affects the people you’re arguing with: They may appear to agree with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something you said inadvertently even offended them—

The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them literally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than argument.

If it does not matter in the long run whether the other person agrees with you—or if time and their own experience will make them understand what you mean—then it is best not even to bother with a demonstration. Save your energy and walk away.

When caught in a lie, the more emotional and certain you appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.

LAW 10 INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY JUDGMENT You can die from someone else’s misery—emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.

The infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing to do with gender. It stems from an inward instability that radiates outward, drawing disaster upon itself.

The reason is simple—humans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking of those with whom they spend their time.

Infectors can be recognized by the misfortune they draw on themselves, their turbulent past, their long line of broken relationships, their unstable careers, and the very force of their character, which sweeps you up and makes you lose your reason.

If, for example, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit; only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then, and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to isolation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those who share your defects—they will reinforce everything that holds you back. Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.

REVERSAL This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their misery; there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.

LAW 11 LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU JUDGMENT To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.
